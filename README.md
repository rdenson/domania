# Domania
## Portable Cloud Domain Inspection
There are quite a few domains and associated record sets that require my care. I
need a portable way to easily see DNS information and check related content. The
scope is relatively tight:
* succinctly view domains for a given account
* report record set values (requested by input)
* check TLS behavior

I don't wanna log into some box to see this info or be constrained by an output
medium (*excel spreadsheet, email, some special report, etc.*). The output should
be able to be fetched over a network and regurgitated in a standard way. Analysis
is too specific, I'll write something else to do that.
